//  the value of a constant cannot change over time; once you initialize a constant (declare it and set it to a value), you cannot change it. Ever. Constant uses the keyword 'let' instead of 'var'.

/* 
 Both variables and constants are useful when you want to associate a name that never changes with a
 value that may change. You can then refer to that variable by a constant name. As shown in the
 playground associated with this lesson, once you associate the name favoriteCharacter with a value ("Jon
 Snow", for example), you can use favoriteCharacter to refer to that value for the rest of the program,
 such as when you pass it to functions like print(). */

/*  
 A variable should be used when a value might change during the course of a single run of a program.
 
 A constant, on the other hand, is a way to bind a name to a value that won't change. This lets you
 refer to that value throughout your program where you are certain without a doubt that the value will
 never change. */
